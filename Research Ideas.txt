Parity Bits - Datastream heals over time.
Volatile Stream - Datastream can do damage to nearby enemies by shooting archs.
	Damage scales over time, but has a limited firerate
Supercharge Stream - Grants ability to supercharge stream, causing it to shoot archs at all enemies at a fast rate for a short while.
Strong Encryption - Reduced damage taken from enemies entering datastream.
Code Capture - Enemies entering datastream grants resources.
Module Blueprints - Prerequisite for a set of research that allows for the creation of modules.
	Blueprints are dropped as loot after this is researched.
	Modules are expensive to create.
Dynamic Reallocation - Structures return 100% of the cost on sell. (Not sure about this, would require default is reduced which might just not be fun)
Code Duplication - Unlocks "Duplicator" structure that grants some amount of credits on wave end.
Code Replication - Unlocks "Replicator" which is the same as duplicator but for research.
Source Control - idk but name sounds cool
Garbage Collection - Grants 2 binaries at the end of each wave.
Lootomatic 2000 - Increases speed and range of collectors
Zero Point Fields - Increase the effect of slowfield generators.
Machine Learning - Grants even more research each wave.
Gradient Descend - Research granted each wave increases over time.
