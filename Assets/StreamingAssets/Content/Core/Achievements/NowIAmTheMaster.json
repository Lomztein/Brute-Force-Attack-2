  "FunFact": "Mastery Mode was purely implemented because it was found to be unfeasible to simply generate stronger and stronger waves, without dynamically modifying enemy health, as the amount of enemies would outgrow what the engine could handle quite quickly. The first BFA game did in fact modify enemy health dynamically, however this was deemed boring, and as such this game instead has tiers of enemies that replace earlier tiers, but even these run out, and as such Mastery Mode comes into play in order to facilitate infinite waves.",
