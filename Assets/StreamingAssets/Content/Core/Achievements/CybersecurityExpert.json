  "FunFact": "When the first BFA was just beginning development, it was actually intended for turret assemblies to be constructed during main gameplay. You'd unlock the various components, then manually place them on the battlefield. This, however, was quickly deemed bothersome, and the concept of \"Assemblies\" was introduced, which shortly thereafter completely replaced turret construction on the fly. To still allow players to make their own assemblies, the Assembly Editor was introduced.",
