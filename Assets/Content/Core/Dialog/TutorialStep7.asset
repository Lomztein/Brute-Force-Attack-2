    Text: Finally, your resources are visible on the very top of the screen. Lines
      of Code, or "LoC" are your basic resource, and Research is what you need to
      research new things. Don't worry about Binaries yet. Now, see which enemies
      are coming up next on the "Upcoming" display up left, build accordingly, and
      start a wave by hitting "Space" or clicking the arrow up to the left. Good
      luck!
