    Text: There are various types of enemies, with each type having several tiers.
      The color of an enemy is important, and a weapon of the same color will do
      double damage to the enemy. It is also important to know that enemies cannot
      go through walls, you should try and use this to your advantage. Some maps
      even allow you to build your own walls as well.
