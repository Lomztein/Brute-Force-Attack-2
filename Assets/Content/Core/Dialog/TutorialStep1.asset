    Text: Alrightus! We'll just quickly go over the most important things you need
      to know. Firstly, to defend the green shit you must place turrets, also known
      as Assemblies, as well as structures. Assemblies are what do the damage while
      structures support your efforts. They are both available in corrosponding tabs
      on the Purchase Menu beneath.
