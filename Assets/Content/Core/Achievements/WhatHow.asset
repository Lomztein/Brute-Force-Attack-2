  Description: Reach Mastery Mode level 2.
  RewardDescription: 
  FunFact: The content system implemented into BFA2 has been implemented for one
    particular reason, that being allowing third parties to develop their own custom
    content for the game. While the base-game content doesn't seek to ever be strong
    enough to allow the player to even get very far into Mastery Mode level 1, you
    never know what other people might come up with.
