  Name: They Never Stop
  Description: Kill one million enemies.
  RewardDescription: Unlocks the Apocalypse Mode mutator, where the enemies NEVER.
    STOP. COMING.
  FunFact: Originally, BFA2 did not support running more than one wave at a time,
    however due to the mutator unlocked by this, it was decided to rework the entire
    wave system to allow for multiple waves at the same time. Worth the several hours
    it took? Definitely.
