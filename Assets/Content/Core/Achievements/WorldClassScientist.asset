  Description: Research all available research options.
  RewardDescription: 
  FunFact: The research system and achievement system shares a lot of functionality
    in how they work. Both systems manage a list of research options / achievements,
    which both has a set of requirements and potential rewards. The difference lies
    in how the requirements are checked, as achievements are checked according to
    their own rules, while research is checked every time a research option has been
    completed.
