  Description: Reach Mastery Mode level 1.
  RewardDescription: 
  FunFact: Mastery Mode was purely implemented because it was found to be unfeasible
    to simply generate stronger and stronger waves, without dynamically modifying
    enemy health, as the amount of enemies would outgrow what the engine could handle
    quite quickly. The first BFA game did in fact modify enemy health dynamically,
    however this was deemed boring, and as such this game instead has tiers of enemies
    that replace earlier tiers, but even these run out, and as such Mastery Mode
    comes into play in order to facilitate infinite waves.
